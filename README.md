ABSTRACT OF THE MODEL
=====================

Having diseases is quite natural in crops due to changing climatic and environmental conditions.
Diseases affect the growth and produce of the crops and often difficult to control.
To ensure good quality and high production, it is necessary to have accurate disease diagnosis and control actions to prevent them in time.
The major fruits grown in India are Mangoes,Grapes,Bananas and it may be affected by different types of diseases on leaf, stem and fruit.
Leaf diseases which are the early symptoms caused due to fungi, bacteria and virus.
The Features are extracted from the segmented diseased part by using different machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Random Forest tree.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
_______________

We have proposed an automated disease detection and classification system for fruit leaves using traditional image processing and machine learning techniques.
Firstly, It segments the Region of interest (ROI) from the back ground using grab cut algorithm and classify the segmented leaves as healthy, black-rot, esca and leaf blight.
By using Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Random Forest Tree Algorithms For comparison of models and we get higher accuracy for Random Forest Tree.
Random Forest algorithm is a supervised learning module used to detect the disease and give more accuracy.
